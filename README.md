# Getting and Cleaning Data

CleanDataProject is a repository that contains my 'Getting and Cleaning Data' course project.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate an ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

The source data represents data collected from the accelerometers and gyroscopes from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.
A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained: 
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

This repository contains:

* 'run_analysis.R' : a script that performs the analysis
* 'CodeBook.md' : a code book that describes data, variables and transformations performed to clean up data.
* 'README.md'
* 'run_analysis_version1.R' :  test version of 'run_analysis.R' script with slightly different order of transformations performed and differently named variables. Essentialy, this script performs the same analysis as the run_analysis.R script, but is NOT the final version and therefore NOT meant to be graded. Also, this script does NOT create txt file.
